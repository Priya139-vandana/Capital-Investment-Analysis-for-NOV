# Capital-Investment-Analysis-for-NOV- Using Alteryx for Data Analysis
The Capital Investment Analysis for National Oil Ventures (NOV) aims to identify the most promising division for stakeholders to invest their money in, aiming to achieve the highest possible return that supports the company's growth and profitability. NOV, a leading player in the energy sector, seeks to make informed decisions about allocating its financial resources to different divisions that maximize returns, minimize risks, and align with its long-term strategic objectives. This comprehensive analysis includes analyzing the historical performance trends of different divisions, companies operating in various countries, and the currency performance of these countries. By leveraging this data, the project aims to pinpoint the division with the greatest potential for generating optimal returns on investments.
# Data Collection
Required Dataset has been provided by company officials. Data sources we have are financial transactions per month (in local currency), Account Mapping dataset, Account Description dataset, Currency by Cost Center dataset and Exchange Rates dataset
# Data Preparation
To prepare the data into a required format that can be used for analysis the first step that has been taken is mapping the relevant datasets and transforming all the records that are in local currency to a single currency which is USD in this case. This complete process has been done using alteryx and the developed workflow has been added in the attachment. 
# Data Analysis
To analyze the data and make meaning insights on the optimal revenue generating dividion, a famous business strategy has been used, which is SWOT analysis.
# Strategy for Future - SWOT
SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats, and so a SWOT analysis is a technique for assessing these four aspects of your business. SWOT Analysis is a tool that can help you to analyze what your company does best now, and to devise a successful strategy for the future. SWOT can also uncover areas of the business that are holding you back, or that your competitors could exploit if you don't protect yourself.
# Strength 
The strength of any business for them to invest is ROC (Return on Capital) generated. On comparing all the three divisions, it has been identified that division A has the highest ROC and with an upward direction. 
# Weakness
Division with lower ROC and with higher operating cost has been considered as the division that is not preferred to invest in. Operating cost in divisions B & C are higher in comparision with division A.
# Opportunity
To identify the furture opportunities for the business, an emerging market analysis has been conducted by taking a public dataset which is GDP growth rate for each country. 
The idea behind the emerging market analysis to identify the countries where the GDP growth rate is in upward direction and find the overall revenue invested in those countries and the ROC that has been generated till date. Upon completion of this it has been identified that Canada and Bolivia are the next emerging market countries where we see a potential growth in business
# Threat
Our major threat for the business is currency conversion as the company is being operated globally. An in-depth analysis has been conducted on the profit percentage change because of price reduction through currency conversion. The idea from this analysis is to identify the countries that are having a highest risk in investment and avoiding those countries. The current analysis has shownt that Bolovia is having a decreasing trend in the profit percentage due to currency conversion
# Conclusion
In conclusion, the investment proposal for Division A in Canada's emerging market is a compelling opportunity for investors seeking higher returns and stability. The country's favorable economic and political environment, along with its stable currency and higher revenue share, make it an ideal destination for investment compared to Division B and Division C.
